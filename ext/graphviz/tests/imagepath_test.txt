# Graphviz test suite
# Tests are separated by blank or comment lines.
# Tests have the following syntax:
#  testname
#  Test input (name of .gv file)
#  One or more subtests of the form: 
#     layout_alg output_format additional_flags
#  
# For example, the test
#   Shapes
#   shapes.gv
#   dot ps
#   neato png "-Gsize=3,3 -Ncolor=red"
# specifies the "shapes" test, using shapes.gv as input, and
# run "dot -Tps" and "neato -Tpng -Gsize=3,3 -Ncolor=red" on the input.
#
#Test graph names indicate the image attribute and the imagepath attribute
#being tested.  For instance val_val.gv, is a graph that has the image
#attribute directory set to a valid directory name and the imagepath attribute 
#directory set to a valid directory name.  Likewise inv_inv.gv has both 
#attribute directories set to an invalid directory name and nul_nul.gv has 
#no setting for the image attribute and the imagepath attribute directories.
#Graphs named with combinations of val, inv and nul have 
#image and imagepath attributes set correspondingly.

#Since this test relies on absolute pathnames, it is necessary to run a 
#shell script to generate the test graphs. 
#Run imagepath_test.sh from within the imagepath_test directory before running 
#rtest on this test suite. This script creates the input graphs and output png 
#files and stores them in the graphs and imagepath_test/nshare directories.
#The png files may be copied into the nshare directory by running 
#imagepath_test/save_png_files.sh when it is appropriate to update the expected 
#test output.

#The graphs in this test suite should also be tested using the mac os user
#interface.  Copy rtest/imagepath_test/image.jpg to the directory graphviz is run
#from. Select each of the test graphs from the graphviz application and visually
#determine whether the tests complete successfully.  The image that is displayed
#during the test should correspond to the expected result message that appears 
#below it.
