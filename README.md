# NEO Programming Language (WIP)

NEO is a small but powerful, fast, and object-oriented scripting language that draws inspiration from the best aspects of Java, Lua, and Python.<br>
It is designed to be easily embedded into any application, making it a versatile choice for various projects.

## Features

- **Small and Fast**: NEO is lightweight and designed for efficiency, allowing your applications to perform optimally without sacrificing performance.

- **Object-Oriented**: Embrace the power of object-oriented programming paradigms to create modular and maintainable code.

- **Easy to Embed**: NEO can seamlessly integrate into your applications through the C99 library, providing a simple and hassle-free way to extend functionality.

- **Familiar Syntax**: If you are already familiar with Java, Lua, or Python, learning NEO will be a breeze. It combines the best elements of these languages, making it easy for developers to transition and start coding right away.

- **Static Typing**: NEO uses static typing, allowing you to write safe and expressive code.

- **Garbage Collection**: Forget about manual memory management. NEO incorporates a robust garbage collector to handle memory allocation and deallocation automatically.
